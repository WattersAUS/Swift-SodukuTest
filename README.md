# Swift-SodukuTest

This is just a proof of concept project that I'm having a play with to learn Swift.

It will undergo lots of changes, some good and some bad as I try different things.

Any suggestions are kindly accepted as long as they are well meant and civil.

If the code interests anyone please fell free to take and pull it apart and use as you see fit.
